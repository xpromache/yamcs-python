Examples
========

All of these examples run against a simulation that is used to
develop and demo Yamcs. This setup is linked to a simple simulator
which emits TM in the form of CCSDS packets and accepts a few
telecommands as well.

Most of the telemetered parameters are in a space system
called ``/YSS/SIMULATOR``.
